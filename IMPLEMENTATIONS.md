# Users CRUD Enhancement - Editable User ID & Affiliates Selection

## Overview

Enhanced the User CRUD system to allow editing user details including the Student ID and adding affiliate association capabilities with a searchable, filterable dropdown.

## Features Added

### 1. Editable User ID

- **Before:** Student ID was disabled when editing (could only be set on creation)
- **Now:** User ID is fully editable when updating a user
- **Backend Logic:** When ID changes, the old user record is deleted and recreated with the new ID to maintain database integrity
- **Validation:** Checks for duplicate IDs before allowing the change

### 2. Affiliates Selection

- **Searchable Dropdown:** Multi-select dropdown with real-time search filtering
- **Affiliate List:** Fetches all available affiliates from the database on component mount
- **Selected Affiliates Display:**
  - Shows count of selected affiliates in the dropdown button
  - Displays selected affiliates as removable badges
  - Each badge has an × button to quickly deselect
- **Search Functionality:**
  - Filter affiliates by name while dropdown is open
  - Case-insensitive search
  - Sticky search input that stays visible while scrolling
- **UI Features:**
  - Multi-select checkboxes for each affiliate
  - Hover effects on affiliate items
  - Scrollable dropdown with max-height
  - Click outside to close dropdown

## Frontend Changes

### Users.tsx Updates

**New State Variables:**

```typescript
const [affiliates, setAffiliates] = useState<any[]>([]);
const [affiliateSearch, setAffiliateSearch] = useState("");
const [isAffiliateDropdownOpen, setIsAffiliateDropdownOpen] = useState(false);
```

**Updated Form Data Structure:**

```typescript
formData: {
  id: string;
  name: string;
  email: string;
  password: string;
  confirmPassword: string;
  role: 'student' | 'intima';
  selectedAffiliates: string[];  // NEW: Array of affiliate IDs
}
```

**New Functions:**

- `fetchAffiliates()` - Fetches all affiliates from `/api/affiliates`
- `handleClickOutside()` - Closes dropdown when clicking outside

**Modified Functions:**

- `resetForm()` - Now includes selectedAffiliates array and affiliate search reset
- `openEditModal()` - Pre-fills selected affiliates from user data
- `handleSaveUser()` - Sends affiliates array to backend, handles ID change with `newId` parameter
- `useEffect` - Added affiliate dropdown click-outside handler

**Dropdown Features:**

- Real-time filtering as user types in search box
- Checkbox management for multi-select
- Display of selected affiliates as removable badges
- Click-outside detection to close dropdown
- Full keyboard and mouse support

### Modal UI Changes:

- Student ID field now editable (no more disabled state)
- New Affiliates field with:
  - Dropdown button showing selection count
  - Searchable list of all affiliates
  - Visual checkboxes
  - Selected affiliates displayed as tagged badges
  - Ability to remove selections directly from badge × buttons

## Backend Changes

### server.ts Updates

**POST /api/users** - Create User

- Now accepts `affiliates` parameter (optional array of affiliate IDs)
- Stores affiliates as JSON stringified array in database

**PUT /api/users/:id** - Update User

- **New Parameters:**
  - `affiliates`: Array of affiliate IDs to associate
  - `newId`: New user ID (if changing from old ID)
- **ID Change Logic:**
  - If `newId` differs from current ID:
    1. Deletes old user record
    2. Creates new record with new ID
    3. Preserves all other user data
  - Validates that new ID is not already in use
- **Affiliates Handling:**
  - Stores affiliates as JSON in database
  - Can be updated independently or with other fields

**Backend Validation:**

- Duplicate ID check when changing user ID
- Duplicate email check (existing)
- Required field validation (existing)

## Data Flow

### Creating User with Affiliates:

1. User fills in form including selecting affiliates from dropdown
2. Frontend sends: `{ id, name, email, password, role, affiliates: ['uuid1', 'uuid2'] }`
3. Backend creates user with affiliate associations
4. Affiliates stored as JSON array in database

### Editing User ID and Affiliates:

1. User opens edit modal
2. Form pre-fills with current data + affiliates loaded from user's affiliates array
3. User can:
   - Change Student ID → frontend sends `{ ..., newId: 'S999999' }`
   - Update affiliates → select/deselect → frontend sends `{ affiliates: ['uuid1', 'uuid3'] }`
   - Both simultaneously
4. Backend handles ID migration (delete old, create new) or simple update

### Affiliate Dropdown Interaction:

1. Click dropdown button → opens list of all affiliates
2. Type in search box → filters affiliates by name
3. Click checkbox → toggles affiliate selection
4. Selected affiliates appear as badges below dropdown
5. Click × on badge → removes selection
6. Click outside → closes dropdown

## Database Integration

**Affiliates Storage:**

- Stored as JSONB in `users.affiliates` column
- Example: `["uuid-1", "uuid-2", "uuid-3"]`
- Allows efficient querying if needed

**Fetched from:**

- `/api/affiliates` endpoint returns all affiliates with id, name, etc.

## API Payload Examples

### Create with Affiliates:

```json
{
  "id": "S123456",
  "name": "John Student",
  "email": "john@example.com",
  "password": "hashed",
  "role": "student",
  "affiliates": ["uuid-sports-club", "uuid-academic-society"]
}
```

### Update ID + Affiliates:

  "name": "John Updated",
  "email": "john@example.com",
  "role": "student",
  "newId": "S654321",
  "affiliates": ["uuid-sports-club"]
}
```

### Update Only Affiliates:

```json
{
  "affiliates": ["uuid-academic-society", "uuid-service-org"]
}
```

| --------------------- | -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
